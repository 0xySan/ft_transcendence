# 🕹️ ft_transcendence – Web-Based Pong & Tetris Experience 🚀

ft_transcendence is a full-stack web application developed as part of the 42 cursus.
It brings together classic retro gaming (Pong & Tetris) with modern web technologies, allowing players to compete, chat, and challenge each other in real time — all inside the browser.

Built from scratch with a focus on clean architecture, security, and scalability, this project goes beyond simple gameplay to explore authentication, WebSockets, REST APIs, and responsive design.
